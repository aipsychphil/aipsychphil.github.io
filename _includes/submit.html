        	<h2>Submissions</h2>
        	<p>Ideal submissions will show how a theory from moral philosophy or moral psychology can be applied in the development or analysis of ethical AI systems. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How can moral philosophers and psychologists best contribute to ethically-informed AI?</li>
				<li>What can theories of developmental moral psychology teach us about making AI?</li>
				<li>How do theories of moral philosophy shed light on modern AI practices?</li>
				<li>How can AI tools advance the fields of moral philosophy and psychology themselves?</li>
				<li>How can findings from moral psychology inform the trustworthiness, transparency or interpretability of AI decision-makers?</li>
				<li>What human values are already embedded in current AI systems?</li>
				<li>Are the values embedded in the current-day AI systems consistent with those in society at large?</li>
				<li>What pluralistic values are missing from current-day AI?</li>
				<li>Methodologically, what is the best way to teach an AI system human values? What are competitors to RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback?</li>
				<li>Concerning AI alignment, to which values are we to align? Is the current practice of AI alignment amplifying monolithic voices? How can we incorporate diverse voices, views and values into AI systems?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Format</h3>
			<p>To apply, submit a short paper (3-8 pages), formatted for double blind review in the standard <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2023/vstgtvjwgdng">NeurIPs format</a>. References do not count towards the page limit. Figures and tables are permitted. Note that papers on the shorter end of the range will be given full consideration. The workshop is non-archival, though there will be an option to have the papers posted on the workshop website. Accepted submissions will be presented as posters</p>
			<p>A small subset of the accepted submissions will be offered the opportunity to present their work as a 5-7-minute talk immediately following one of the invited talks. These short talks will be framed as a “discussion” or “commentary” on the main talk. The short talks will deal with a similar theme as that discussed in the main talk, but from a different theoretical or methodological perspective. These talks can (and should) present the author’s original work, as well as explicitly address the way that their work challenges or supplements the work of the main speaker. On the submission page, there is an opportunity to indicate if you would like your submission to be considered for a short talk and, if so, which invited speaker you see as potentially most relevant (though this is simply a suggestion to the organizers). Those submissions accepted as short talks can also be presented as posters. Preference will be given to junior scholars. In addition, the organizers are committed to many forms of intellectual and sociological diversity—those from under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.</p>
